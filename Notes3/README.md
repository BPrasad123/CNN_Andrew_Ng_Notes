# Machine_Learning_Strategy
During the lifecycle of ML model not the same set of actions are taken for better result. Depending upon the stage of the ML model like training or test, corresponding recommended actions are taken as illustrated in the image below.

## Classifier Evaluation Metric ##
At times, finding out the best among a number of classifier with different presicion and recall would be difficult. Hence in that case considering their F1 score for this decision is appropriate.

Bayes Optimal Error (Bayes Error):  
The best possible error theoritically that a model cannot surpass.  

## Bias Vs Variance Reduction ##
As we know that Bayes error is the best possible error and if the training error deviates much from it then focus should be on bias reduction. If there is much difference in the error of training and that of test then variance issue needs to be addressed.
